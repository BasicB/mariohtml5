This is a port of Mr. Keffner's Mario game to the Android platform. I will say it is so buggy as of right now, and requires
the use of a keyboard. I will continually work on it. I really just wanted to show how an HTML5 game can be 
converted into an Android game. With some tweaks, or a lot of tweaks, it may be playable :)
